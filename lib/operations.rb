def unsafe?(speed)

if speed > 60
  puts "true"
  elsif speed < 40
  puts "true"
  else 40 < speed > 60
  puts "false"
end
	
# Use an `if`/`else` statement pair to build the `unsafe?` method. It should return `true` if the speed is either below `40` or above `60`. *Going 30 mph on the freeway would be unsafe, as would going 95 mph. Going 50 miles per hour, however, would return `false` as that's within the "safe" range.*
# Build the method `not_safe?` that is a version of your previous `unsafe?` method but use the ternary operator (`?:`) instead of an `if`/`else` statement pair.
